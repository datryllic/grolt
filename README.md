# Grolt

I grolt, therefore I am.

I am Grolt.

There's no place like Grolt.


## Erm, what?

Yeah, sorry about that.
Grolt is a Docker-based development and testing framework for Neo4j.


## Can I use it and, if so, how do I use it?

You can, but the surface is still undergoing stabilisation, so be prepared for things to break.

Grolt requires python 3. Depending on your local configuration You may need to use `python3` or `alias python=python3` before running the installation command.

To install Grolt in developer mode, simply run:
```
python setup.py develop
```

The primary interface is through the CLI, so to see the options available, use:
```
grolt --help
```
